YouTube used to be a place where I could escape the noisy world and watch long technical videos on topics that I would have otherwise never had exposure to. Whilst that content still exists on the website, it is being exponentially drowned out by lower quality videos designed to trap you in an attention loop. I have tried to tailor my homepage by marking these videos as "not interested" but YouTube keeps surfacing this type of content and it is quite tiring to filter it out all the time. My subscriptions offer some respite but one of the amazing things about YouTube 10 years ago was that I could get recommended videos on niche topics quite consistently, and the people creating the content were doing it with no motives other than sharing their personal interests. Nowadays even educational / academic content creators have to limit the depth of their videos so that they are favoured by the algorithm and ultimately so they can make enough money to pay the bills. 
### ***That being said***
I still love some YouTube channels, below are some videos / channels that I love:
